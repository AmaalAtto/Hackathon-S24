# Codedex Hackathon-S24

This was my very first hackathon. When I signed up I was planning on do the data science since that is what i'm most comfortable with. But when hackathon day came I wanted to do the web dev, even though I knew nothing about web development. I attended an intro to web dev workshop codedex was hosting and tried my best with this project. It's been challenging but vey fun.
